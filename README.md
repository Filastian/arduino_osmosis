## Schematic

Arduino Nano board is used. All “approximate” schematic diagrams can be found in my [Wokwi project](https://wokwi.com/projects/422436947322570753).

> _Note: the project and the schema in the projects are aimed at testing. In fact, some elements in the schematic should be replaced by other elements. This does not affect the code's operability in any way_
